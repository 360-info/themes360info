# themes360info 0.0.2

* Changed the error when installed fonts aren't found to a warning, so that the
  package can still be used for assessment purposes without the installed fonts.
* The option for expressing a font preference is now
  `themes360info.franklin.pref` (previously `themes360info.franklin`)

# themes360info 0.0.1
